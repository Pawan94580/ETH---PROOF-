**Project Title**

Solidity MyToken

**Description**

In this project I am creating and destroying the token by using two functions Mint function and Burn function. In Mint function I am assinging the value and by using Burning function I am destroying the value that I assinged to mint function

In this project I am mainly maintaing the record of tokens for each and every balances for every addresses.

MyToken is mainly used for learning purposes , experimentation  or as a foundational contract for more complex decentralized applications.

**Getting Started**

**Installing**

**To get started with MyToken, you'll need to have the following installed:**

Node.js

npm (Node Package Manager)

Truffle or Hardhat (development frameworks for Ethereum)

**How to Download**

**Clone the repository from GitHub:**

git clone https://github.com/Pawan94580/MyToken.git

After code it. First of all named your file according to your choice and compile it. After compiling it deploy the code. when code deploy completely copy the address and paste it in the fuction and assign the 
value to the fuctions that you created.
You are also able to check the total balance by pasting the address of the code.
